## Preamble

Two months have passed since we, the community, started Project Modern in the light of Magic’s current demise. Initially known and advertised as PreWar Modern, it became clear very early on that people were more interested in a fixed Modern format than a capsule of times past. As the community grew in size, so did the idea of [what we wanted from ​Project Modern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fF4kSfG8s-fbm6kYVDX7d6VrATXdCMOaNr2aPDfY9eQ)​.

Today marks the day we are finally ready to start into this new endeavour: Our ​website is live, organized play has been set up and ​data accumulation has been automated. All that is left to do is to actually play some games of Magic!

Therefore, we are happy to announce the following changes to the format.

## Set additions

As of June 1st, 2020 War of the Spark (WAR) and Modern Horizons (MH1) are legal for organized play​.

As previously laid out through our ​roadmap​, this is but the first extension to come with additional sets following in July and August. This process of staggered implementation ensures the effectiveness of our analytical division and therefore provides the ability to isolate and neutralize specifically problematic cards.

In order to ensure the council’s accountability in regards to the changes being made, the [accumulated data](https://projectmodern.gg/metagame) is going to be accessible for everyone through our website and we are going to keep listening to your inquiries and proposals. At this point we would also like to provide a word of caution: The format is not going to start out as an utopia for everyone. It will take time and effort to shift the overall balance back to where it is healthy for the format as a whole without damaging too many archetypes along the way.

With this in mind, we made preliminary changes to the Banned & Restricted list.

## Bannings

As of June 1st, 2020 the following cards are banned from organized play:
 - [Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis](​https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/202/hogaak-arisen-necropolis​)
 - [Arcum's Astrolabe](​https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe​)
 - [Mycosynth Lattice](​https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/241/mycosynth-lattice​)


These changes were made based on historical data from the past year.

[Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/202/hogaak-arisen-necropolis) has proven to be a severe design mistake as it combines two mana
reduction mechanics in Delve and Convoke, thereby circumventing conventional means of
utilizing mana as a resource to cast spells and develop the boardstate. In addition to the velocity
and raw power [Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/202/hogaak-arisen-necropolis) adds to graveyard based strategies, it also provides consistency (being
castable from graveyard) as well as evasion (trample) which makes it specifically difficult to deal with.

[Arcum’s Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe) homogenizes the construction of mana bases across archetypes by providing any kind of mana while simultaneously interacting positively with other snow permanents as well as artifacts. Moreover, [Arcum's Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe) being a cantrip reduces the opportunity cost to a degree where there is almost no downside in utilizing it over additional copies of e.g. shocklands for 3+ color decks, thereby making it more difficult for aggressive / tempo oriented archetypes to exploit weaknesses of midrange, control & combo decks. Lastly, [Arcum’s Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe) also mitigates the susceptibility of multicolored mana bases to counterplay in the forms of e.g. [Blood Moon](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/122/blood-moon).

[Mycosynth Lattice](https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/241/mycosynth-lattice)​, while very niche, has shown to provide for repetitive and unfun play patterns in combination with ​[Karn, the Great Creator](https://scryfall.com/card/war/1/karn-the-great-creator)​. The ability to wish [Mycosynth Lattice](https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/241/mycosynth-lattice) out of the sideboard where it cannot be interacted with, along with imposing the lock in itself, is too good and too consistent of an addition for especially big mana strategies. While [Karn, the Great Creator](https://scryfall.com/card/war/1/karn-the-great-creator) could have been a potential alternative, it presents a mainboardable counterplay to artifact based strategies fueled by [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/223/mox-opal) and therefore has a role in balancing out the format.

## Watchlist Unbans

The council has reached a consensus about [​Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/460/preordain) being suitable for Modern both in terms of power level and facilitated gameplay. The original reason for [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/460/preordain)'s ban from Modern, namely the nature of Storm decks being too consistent, has been negated by a rise in overall power level as well as additional counterplay in the forms of [​Flusterstorm](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/55/flusterstorm) and ​[Force of Negation​](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/52/force-of-negation). As a result, the addition of [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/460/preordain) will add to the diversity of cards and archetypes being playable in the format. Nonetheless, we refrained from unbanning [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/460/preordain) at this point in time as to not affect our baseline data on ​[Faithless Looting​](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/919/faithless-looting) and ​UR Phoenix​ specifically.

## Watchlist Bans

The council has decided to inform you of certain cards and strategies that are being monitored for the future health of Project Modern. This means that, without other unforeseen issues arising, our data analysis is going to target these cards specifically. They represent long term concerns to overall format diversity and play patterns, but may be considered healthy given more data in the future. It also means that we may act on any of these cards at any point in time given enough reason to do so.

[Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/919/faithless-looting) used to be one of the most iconic cards in Modern before its banning - both loved and hated by the community. Its reputation of being a very powerful enabler for combo and graveyard based aggro strategies precede it, but we would like to give it another chance before acting on it. There are significant concerns, especially in regards to graveyard centric sets like Theros Beyond Death and the addition of the escape mechanic pushing the limit on [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/mb1/919/faithless-looting) even further. While future problems are on the horizon, decks like Bridgevine, Dredge and UR Phoenix are already leading the charge and need to be balanced in favor of format diversity. We realize that this card is going to cause controversy no matter the outcome, which is why we are trying to be as open and transparent about the process as possible. [Bridge From Below](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/87/bridge-from-below) in combination with a sac outlet such as ​[Altar Of Dementia](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/218/altar-of-dementia) tend to lead to very fast kills from both the graveyard as well as the battlefield in ways that are difficult to interact with for most decks, however they also tend to be glass cannons. We are going to monitor the metagame closely in regards to the performance of graveyard centric decks. In the event of archetypes involving one or both of these cards receiving a significant share in the metagame while also reaching top results in tournament play, we are going to take a closer look at the issue at hand in order to isolate which card brings the most unfair or unfun parts of these decks to fruition.

[Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler) has proven to facilitate play patterns that are received as unfun by a significant margin of the player base while also shutting down some archetypes and mechanics in their entirety. Outside of boardstates involving multiple threats, [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler) is very difficult to interact with due to the forced play at sorcery speed as well as the bounce ability - this is especially true for decks utilizing [Force of Negation](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/52/force-of-negation) as a means of protection. While we do not believe that [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler) is critical in terms of powerlevel alone, we are aware of the overall sentiment towards [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler) and may take action in case of widespread utilization leading to stale and repetitive gameplay.

[Urza, Lord High Artificer​](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer), resides at the top of Modern’s Metagame ever since its printing in MH1. In the light of one of the most iconic characters of Magic history, multiple archetypes were recreated and homogenized around it. While [Urza, High Lord Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer) does represent a high power level, has utility in multiples despite being Legendary due to its ETB effect and shows to be very resilient to common hate, the removal of [Arcum’s Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe) from the format should weaken the archetype in a variety of ways. We are therefore going to monitor the metagame evolve with [Urza, High Lord Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer) in it and act as soon as it becomes a problem.

## Closing Note

As a last note, we would like to add that we are currently in the process of testing [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin) and appreciate the widespread support from the community in our testing efforts. It is too early to announce a verdict in either direction, but we wanted to let you know that we are in fact working on it!
