## Set Legality

As of July 1st, 2020 Core Set 2020 (M20) and Throne of Eldraine (ELD) are legal for [organized play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-F_6Ofi286X3D_1V0W2ifajOklR58ZfCsZhGw2lvcoc).

As previously laid out through our [roadmap](https://discord.com/channels/701518582118482004/711655703558881390), this is the second set extension with Ikoria, THB, and Core21 following in August. At that point, we will have caught up with WotC Modern in terms of card pool legality, allowing us to move forward on a set by set basis.

## Metagame Data

![Metagame Snapshot](july-first-metagame.png)

We have been monitoring the development of the metagame in June with regards to our watchlist for bannings consisting of [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer), [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting), [Bridge From Below](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/87/bridge-from-below), and [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler). It has shown a drastic imbalance between aggressive, graveyard fueled decks enabled by [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) and the rest of the field. 30%-60% of the metagame represented archetypes that were heavily leaning on graveyards as their primary or secondary resource of card advantage, velocity & consistency. Although there are differences between paper and digital metagames, these characteristics became more and more prevalent over time on both platforms.

Comparing individual decks within this super-archetype yields the following conclusions:

 - Dredge (8,47% of the Meta) & Mono-Red Phoenix (5% of the Meta) had the highest overall win rate of all decks being played in June with 92% and 75% win rates against the field, respectively.
 - Not only did they account for the highest win rates, but were also among the most played archetypes alongside UR Phoenix representing 6,78% of the field (29% win rate against the field).
 - While decks like Hollow One (46% win rate), UR Phoenix (29% win rate), Mardu Pyromancer (50% win rate) and Bridgevine (35% win rate) contributed a significant portion to the overall meta share, they seemed to suffer more from targeted hate and overall positioning against the field than the aforementioned.

What does this tell us?

On the one hand, the top three most played decks were [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) decks of which two had astronomically high win rates across tournaments and platforms. Despite a growing number of targeted hate cards in decklists over time (4 to 6, 5 pieces per deck), these two decks maintained high win rates against the field. Simultaneously, the more fair versions of [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) decks underperformed consistently.

Aside from the [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) supertype, Eldrazi (ETron & ETaxes) variants were overperforming in regards to their meta share (5% &1,7%) in correlation with win rates (78% & 75%). If this was just the case because they were especially well equipped to fight the graveyard decks or were potentially favored against the decks that were hunting down graveyard decks remains to be seen.

Midrange and Control variants saw some play at the beginning of June but rapidly declined into non-existence towards the end of June, underperforming continuously.

As a last note, we would like to mention that combo as an archetype was prominently absent from the metagame altogether.

With this in mind, we made the following changes to the Banned & Restricted list.

## Bannings

As of July 1st, 2020 the following cards are banned from organized play:

 - [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting)
 - [Veil of Summer](https://scryfall.com/card/m20/198/veil-of-summer)
 - [Oko, Thief of Crowns](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/197/oko-thief-of-crowns)
 - [Once Upon a Time](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/169/once-upon-a-time)


 - [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) used to be one of the most iconic cards in Modern - both loved and hated by the community. Its reputation of being a powerful enabler for combo and graveyard based aggro strategies precede it. After being a dominant force in Project Modern since its inception, it is time to face the truth: A repeatable effect that allows players to move cards between zones voluntarily for one mana is too potent to remain a part of the format. While there is a certain amount of archetypes being enabled by [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting), the underlying problem for potential predators is not being able to interact with the threats that most Looting decks rely on. Repeatedly bringing back [Arclight Phoenix](https://scryfall.com/card/grn/91/arclight-phoenix) in addition to generating incremental card advantage through cards like [Lava Dart](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/134/lava-dart), [Life From the Loam](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/172/life-from-the-loam) or [Vengevine](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/189/vengevine) at close to no cost is too much for other strategies to overcome. Additionally, [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) reinforces the discrepancy in play patterns between games one and games two / three in which both sides are looking to find specific hate and anti-hate pieces in order to shut each other down. There have been significant concerns, especially in regards to graveyard centric sets like Theros Beyond Death and the addition of the escape mechanic pushing the limit on [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) even further which is why we considered now to be the appropriate time to act on [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting).

 - [Oko, Thief of Crowns](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/197/oko-thief-of-crowns) After the release of Throne of Eldraine, Oko dominated the meta, mostly in conjunction with [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer). However, Oko was an omnipresent part of the format, showing up in decks where he was completely off gameplan, such as Death’s Shadow. The argument for the best planeswalker of all time starts and ends with Oko, as his high loyalty and strong abilities make dealing with him a nightmare and games devolved to mostly being about Oko.

 - [Once Upon a Time](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/169/once-upon-a-time) Free spells are always strong, and [Once Upon a Time](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/169/once-upon-a-time) is no exception. While not being as omnipresent as Oko, [Once Upon a Time](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/169/once-upon-a-time) saw play in almost every deck that could use it, and added unneeded consistency to decks like Amulet Titan and Neobrand. In addition, decks that previously did not play green added it to the deck in order to splash [Once Upon a Time](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/169/once-upon-a-time).

 - [Veil of Summer](https://scryfall.com/card/m20/198/veil-of-summer), outside of Legacy, mostly sees play as a sideboard card. However, for its cost, it’s far too efficient and all-encompassing. Interactive mirrors become about who drew more copies of Veil, and uninteractive decks got to have an answer to interactivity that stopped all but 2 of the most commonly played interactive cards, [Path to Exile](https://scryfall.com/card/cma/19/path-to-exile) and [Lightning Bolt](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/141/lightning-bolt).

## Unbannings

The Council has reached a consensus about [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) being suitable for Modern both in terms of power level and facilitated gameplay. The original reason for [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain)'s ban from Modern, namely the nature of Storm Decks being too consistent, has been negated by a rise in overall power level as well as additional counterplay in the forms of [Flusterstorm](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/55/flusterstorm) and [Force of Negation](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/52/force-of-negation). As a result, the addition of [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) will add to the diversity of cards and archetypes being playable in the format.

As stated before, [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) was only held back due to baseline data accumulation in June and will now be released. Since Combo decks were a non-factor until now and [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) provides additional consistency, we hope to give the archetype another tool in order to re-emerge and become a part of Project Modern. Additionally, [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) might be able to facilitate some sort of UR Phoenix builds as Haggle / Merchant of the Veil entered the format as a weaker [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting) replacement.

## Watchlist Bans

The Council has decided to inform you of certain cards and strategies that are being monitored for the future health of Project Modern. This means that, without other unforeseen issues arising, our data analysis is going to target these cards specifically. They represent long term concerns to overall format diversity and play patterns, but may be considered healthy given more data in the future. It also means that we may act on any of these cards at any point in time given enough reason to do so.

[Bridge From Below](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/87/bridge-from-below) in combination with a sac outlet such as [Altar Of Dementia](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/218/altar-of-dementia) tends to lead to very fast kills from both the graveyard as well as the battlefield in ways that are difficult to interact with for most decks, however, they also tend to be glass cannons. We are going to monitor the Metagame closely in regards to the performance of graveyard centric decks. In the event of archetypes involving one or both of these cards receiving a significant share in the metagame while also reaching top results in tournament play, we are going to take a closer look at the issue at hand in order to isolate which card brings the most unfair or unfun parts of these decks to fruition. As of July first, Bridgevine decks have performed significantly worse than their Dredge / Phoenix counterparts despite having seen widespread play. With the banning of [Faithless Looting](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/140/faithless-looting), we will monitor the performance of Bridgevine decks in July in the new environment.

[Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler) has proven to facilitate play patterns that are received as unfun by a significant margin of the player base while also shutting down some archetypes and mechanics in their entirety. Outside of board states involving multiple threats, Teferi is very difficult to interact with due to the forced play at sorcery speed as well as the bounce ability - this is especially true for decks utilizing [Force of Negation](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/52/force-of-negation) as a means of protection. While we do not believe that Teferi is critical in terms of power level alone, we are aware of the overall sentiment towards Teferi and may take action in case of widespread utilization leading to stale and repetitive gameplay. As of July first, Teferi has only seen play in less than 1% of archetypes and is therefore not being considered a potential threat to format health at this moment in time. We will keep monitoring the card though.

[Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer), resides at the top of Modern’s Metagame ever since its printing in MH1. In the light of one of the most iconic characters of Magic history, multiple archetypes were recreated and homogenized around it. While Urza does represent a high power level, has utility in multiples despite being Legendary due to its ETB effect and shows to be very resilient to common hate, the removal of [Arcum’s Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe) from the format has apparently weakened the archetype in a variety of ways. As of July first, there has only been one registered decklist featuring [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer) accounting for a 0% win percentage in 5 competitive matches. This is not statistically significant and might be tied to the pilot, but it is the only data to work with. With the addition of Throne of Eldraine specifically, the Council expects the archetype to receive a power boost in [Emry, Lurker of the Loch](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/43/emry-lurker-of-the-loch), [Gilded Goose](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/160/gilded-goose) as well as [Mystic Sanctuary](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/247/mystic-sanctuary) which is why we will keep monitoring the metagame in regards to [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer).

## Closing Note

 As a last note, we would like to add that we are currently in the process of testing Splinter Twin and appreciate the widespread support from the community in our testing efforts. It is too early to announce a verdict in either direction, but we wanted to let you know that we are in fact still working on it! As a next step, we are going to create a Splinter Twin League (6 players, curated archetypes, 1 Splinter Twin deck) through our newly implemented League System. If you would like to help/participate, please contact the staff from organized play.
